# Challenges – Nimble

## Estimation Time and Resouces
- There are currently 2 main features: Login and Home page.
- The maximum estimation time I can arrange for the test is 40 hours.

## Risk management
- With the current ability plus the total time I have, I estimate it is impossible to complete the 2 features completely. Not to mention the login section related to GraphQL, this part I just know briefly, no experience working with it, so adding time to research is quite risk.

## Choose the most suitable strategy
Choose a strategy:
Currently, based on current time and resources there are two strategies:
1. Do the full features and do not care much about the criteria when coding (skip even testing)
2. Select a feature and complete that feature

Based on client expectations - be the reviewer of my code. I predict his expectation is to learn the ability to code, think, style and discipline when coding, so **I chose option 2**. And the feature I will do is the **Home features**.

Nearly everything matches my estimation time since the available time is just enough for me to implement the UI prototype of the authentication section.

## Final decision

Implementation time after defining specific targets:
- Read requirement, check UI and APIs - define use case: 3 hours
- Network part: 8 hours
- Database part: 8 hours
- Prototype and implementation details: 10 hours
- Composible part: 8 hours
- Buffer time for fix bugs: 3 hours

## Delivery feature
- The real time that I could arrange to do the test: **22**
- Below is my features which I can deliver now: 

**UI Prototype of three screens**: 4 hours ✅

**Home screen:** 
- Read requirement, check UI and APIs - define use case: 3 hours  ✅
- Network part: 8 hours  ✅
- Database part: 8h hours ✅
- UI implementation details: (need 6 hours to finish but I don't have time anymore) ❌
- Composible part: (need 8 hours to finish but I don't have time anymore) ❌
- Buffer time for fix bugs: (need 3 hours to finish but I don't have time anymore) ❌
